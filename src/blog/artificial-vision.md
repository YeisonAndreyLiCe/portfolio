## Kind of Algorithms

- Input Image -> Output Image: Image Processing.
  - Image Processing: Image processing is a method to perform some operations
    on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful
    information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an
    image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with
    that image.
- 3D input image -> 2D output image: Graphics computing
  - Graphics computing: Graphics computing is a method to perform some
    operations on a 3D image, in order to get a 2D image or to extract some useful
    information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is a 3D
    image and output may be a 2D image or characteristics/features associated with
    that image.

## Image Processing on the space domain

We don't use transformations. Instead we ise pixels information as well as gray levels.

### Geometric Processing

- rotation.
- Zoom.

### Histogram Processing

- Equalization of histogram.

### Arithmetic Operations

- Addition.
- Multiplication.

### Spatial filters

- Convolution.
