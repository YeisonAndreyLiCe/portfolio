The Königsberg bridge problem
The Königsberg bridge problem is a famous problem in graph theory that was
solved by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1736. The problem is named
after the city of Königsberg, which is now Kaliningrad, Russia. The city is
located on the Pregel River and is divided into four landmasses by the river
and its two tributaries. The city had seven bridges that connected the
landmasses, as shown in the diagram below.

The problem was to find a walk through the city that would cross each bridge
exactly once and return to the starting point. Euler solved the problem by
representing the landmasses as vertices and the bridges as edges in a graph.
He then proved that such a walk was not possible by analyzing the degrees of
the vertices in the graph.

## What is a graph?

A graph is a mathematical structure that consists of a set of vertices
(also called nodes) and a set of edges that connect the vertices. Graphs are
used to model relationships between objects or entities in various fields, such
as computer science, mathematics, social sciences, and more. Another way if
seem them is to think of them as a collection of points (vertices) connected by
lines (edges), non-linear data structures that are used to represent
relationships between objects.
