Let's start by recalling what functional programming (FP) is all about. It's a
style of programming (parading) where we use functions to break down problems
into smaller parts. Instead of using data structures like objects or arrays,
we rely more on functions and their interactions. So, for example, we might use
higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments.

Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions and transformations over
data structures. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens,
which means they can be passed around as arguments, returned from other
functions, and assigned to variables. This allows for a more declarative and
concise style of programming.

## Key Concepts of Functional Programming

### Pure Functions

A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same
input and has no side effects. This means that a pure function does not modify
any external state or data. Pure functions are deterministic, which means they
always produce the same output given the same input.

### Immutability

Immutability is the concept of not changing the state of an object once it has
been created. In functional programming, data is treated as immutable, which
means that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. Instead
of modifying existing data, we create new data structures by applying
transformations to the original data.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or
return functions as results. This allows us to create abstractions and compose
functions together to solve complex problems. Higher-order functions are a key
feature of functional programming and enable us to write more modular and
reusable code.

### Recursion

Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem.
Recursion is a powerful tool in functional programming and allows us to write
elegant and concise code. By breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems
and solving them recursively, we can solve complex problems with simple and
elegant solutions.

### Referential Transparency

Referential transparency is the property of a function that allows us to replace
a function call with its result without changing the behavior of the program.
This property enables us to reason about our code more easily and makes it
easier to test and debug.

### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to create
a new function. By composing functions together, we can create complex
transformations and abstractions from simpler functions. Function composition is
a powerful technique in functional programming and allows us to build modular
and reusable code.

## Currying

Currying is a technique in which a function that takes multiple arguments is
transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying
allows us to create new functions by partially applying arguments to an existing
function. This enables us to create more flexible and reusable functions and
simplify the process of function composition.

## Monads

Monads are a design pattern in functional programming that provides a way to
structure and sequence computations. Monads encapsulate values and operations
on those values, allowing us to chain together computations in a predictable and
composable way. Monads are a powerful abstraction that enables us to write
complex programs in a clear and concise manner.
