# Python

The simplicity the Python makes the language a great option for almost everyone
aiming to use programming in any field. This is the reason Python is widely
used in the industry, from web development, data science, machine learning,
automation, scientific computing, and more. Having a huge community, and a vast
number of libraries, Python is a great choice for beginners and experts alike.

In this post, we will explore some of the best features of Python, and how you
can use them to your advantage.

## Generators

Generators are a great way to work with large files, or large data sets. They
allow you to work with data in chunks, without having to load the entire data
into memory.

```python
import aiofiles
import asyncio
import json


async def main():
    async with aiofiles.open("article.json", mode="r") as file:
        contents = await file.read()
        data = json.loads(contents)
        print(data)

asyncio.run(main())
```
