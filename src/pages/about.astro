  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about building innovative web applications and solving
      complex problems through technology. With expertise in full-stack
      development , I work with modern technologies like React, Node.js, Python,
      GraphQL, and AWS, delivering robust, scalable solutions. As a dedicated
      software engineer, I’m also an avid writer, sharing insights on web
      development, programming, data science, and the latest in technology.

          Before diving into programming, I began my academic journey at the
          National University of Colombia. In 2021 I made decision to leave
          university and fully commit to a career as a developer. After having
          worked in software development for 1 year, I started a <strong
            >computer science</strong
          >
          degree at the same university. Thanks to my previous studies, I was able
          to validate several subjects, so I am in the 4th semester.
