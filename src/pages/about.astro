          I am software development, I work on web development as full stack
          with React, Typescript, Python, AWS, Graphql, and Gatsby.

          Before diving into programming, I began my academic journey at the
          National University of Colombia. In 2021 I made decision to leave
          university and fully commit to a career as a developer. After having
          worked in software development for 1 years, I started a <strong
            >computer science</strong
          >
          degree at the same university. Thanks to my previous studies, I was able
          to validate several subjects, so I am in the 4th semester.
        </p>

        <p>
          I live in Medellin since 2018. My native language is Spanish, I have a
          B2 level in English and a B1 level in French.
